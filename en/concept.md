# FreePe - the beginning of a new life for everyone

### Problem

The current global economic system is more and frequently demonstrates it's inconsistency and inability to cope with the challenges that are demanded by society and required by nature.

* Highly speculative currencies;
* Commission of the financial operations;
* False reviews on the Internet;
* Corruption and fraud;
* Understated payment for labor;
* The complexity of the development in the beginning;
* No pricing transparency;
* Low level of trust on the Internet;
* The necessary tools are divided into different services;

### Solution

The concept of FreePe project is to create a space for interaction on the Internet and beyond using peer to peer (p2p) FreeChain technology. This technology will give people opportunities quantum space civilization - total spectrum of humanity possibilities, using the talents, skills, capabilities and resources of the planet, allowing to analyze the probable events and calculate the most appropriate action to meet the challenges of any scopes and areas.

** The FreePe purpose ** is to unite people around the world to build a joint project - a decentralized socio-economic network "FreePe" that would satisfy the needs and desires of each participant. The implementation of project will provide free exchange of services, information and resources, based on mutual control networks of participants and the use of a secured equivalent value that can be converted into any currency.

Just imagine for a moment if instead of a plurality of social networks, search engines, labor exchanges, blokchains - would be a unified versatile network, which includes the best ideas, projects, applications, components, and contains only high-quality products or services, and every user - is a real human. This would allow millions of people to communicate, work, plan, manage, process and resolve all personal and social problems through a universal interface that works on any hardware platform - computer, phone, car or robot. Now, just add here the fact that all this belongs to the users - that is, you!

FreePe is created as a gift to all mankind to unite healthy people and to build real Heaven on Earth, because it is possible. When one million people make a joint project, which includes one million unique ideas - it is much more effective than each doing its own periodically "reinventing the wheel".

### Plan

It is sufficient to create an interactive space for collaboration and co-creation with favorable opportunities for self-realization of each member. Then organize community-minded with a high level of trust, where each participant - a real person. To this end, we extend their referral links among their friends, acquaintances, colleagues, and other stakeholders who know personally. Then, introduce elements of gamification and trust - the level of reputation and rating. Then we fill the network with all sorts of goods and services - everything is transparent, fair and open, with a focus on companies that make high quality products and are not afraid to show their income because they honestly earned. So we are going to build their own world, which is like a large egregor egregor. Then the people, seeing how nice and cool with us, and we will rush to the great egregore will rapidly lose weight. His place as the biggest egregor sensible people take our guaranteeing everyone a great standard of living in the prosperity of peace, harmony and climbing, where in the first place will reign true human values. That way we can change our society from within.

If you take Bitcoin, where the money is issued based on the decision difficult, but useless tasks on the computer, the internal unit of FreePe - FreePenny could be generated for the provision of free disk space, processing power, bandwidth, or performing useful work, realizing their talents - literally speaking, fulfilling the desires and needs of the network society.

### Benefit

FreePe will be installed on any hardware platform and allows you to create a network of devices available nearby through any means of communication - radio, wire and so on. The network of different hardware platforms \ (computers, mobile phones, cars, ATMs, etc \), which has no center and distributes data on demand, and uses the processing power of the nodes themselves.

In addition, each platform will receive the appropriate interface - look to interact with text fields, buttons, and other elements that the user can customize yourself by he needed facilities for any activity: personal and group correspondence, creation and management of companies, search for goods and services , investment, work, business partners, employees, financial transactions - all this and more will be available in one place.

Through unified API you could connect to a variety of different services - for example, to pull the VK, Facebook and Telegram chats for easy communication with friends from different platforms or to place ads on various bulletin boards such as OLX, Ebay, Craiglist etc. The same can be said about the various systems of reputation, trust and generally speaking any necessary logic.

Implementation of FreePe will open the amazing possibilities for everyone:

- Realize your unique potential and improve the quality of life, doing interesting and useful work;
- Acquire high-quality goods and services, track their path, composition, manufacturing process and pricing;
- Finding honest partners, decent-minded people and form production, creative and other unions with collective management;

- Clean the environment of corruption, fraud, deception, through mutual control participants and a unified chain of events.

### Key aspects

** Reliability **  - organization of peer-to-peer networks for computing and data storage with multiple servers, which makes it impossible ddos attacks, physical destruction of individual servers or use of any kind of lock is also no harm.

** Scalability ** - The modular architecture with the simple addition of any required functionality, you can connect third-party services, such as social networks or blokchains.

** Efficiency ** - High performance, fast speed, low cost, because users who often use the Internet could use their PCs as servers.

**Free People.   
Free Information.   
Free Money.
